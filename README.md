# Customer Segmentation using Clustering
## Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their demographic and behavioral data, using clustering algorithms. The segmentation aims to provide insights into customer behavior, which can help businesses design targeted marketing strategies and improve customer experiences.

### Dataset
#### Source: Mall_Customers.csv
#### Description: The dataset contains information about mall customers, including:
#### CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
#### Gender: Gender of the customer.
#### Age: Age of the customer.
#### Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
#### Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned by the mall based on customer spending behavior and loyalty.
## Project Workflow
### Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the dataset and explore its structure and basic statistics.
Visualize feature distributions using plots (e.g., KDE plots, bar charts).
### Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values (if any).
Remove unnecessary columns (e.g., CustomerID).
Scale numerical features for clustering.
### Clustering:

Apply clustering algorithms such as K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering.
Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method or Dendrograms.
Analyze cluster characteristics.
### Visualization:

Visualize clusters using scatter plots and analyze key patterns (e.g., income vs. spending score).
Insights and Recommendations:

Identify actionable insights based on customer segments.
Provide recommendations for marketing strategies.
## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
### Libraries:
numpy and pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn: Data visualization.
sklearn: Clustering algorithms and scaling.
